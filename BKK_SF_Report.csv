He simply doesn?t have the time to stay on top of it and tries to take care of everything every couple of months but usually it slips until the end of the year. At that point he is super far behind at it takes him tons of time to get it sorted and it?s stressful. He knows that he is missing deductions, os wants a professional to take care of it so he doesn?t have to worry. 

Right now he is taking care of it himself on Freshbooks. Once the expenses are entered and the receipts are uploaded he passes the P&L off to his accountant. He doesn?t love that process because he doesn?t want to do and doesn?t know exactly how to do it.

They are growing a lot right now and recognize that they need some help with the finances so that they can continue to grow properly. They want to have proper processes in place so that their paperwork is taken care of and they don't have to worry about the admin side of things as much. 

Pauls's wife Pam has been the one taking care of the bookkeeping. When the team buys something she grabs the receipt and manually enters it into FreshBooks. It's time-consuming for her and she is not totally sure what she is doing so not sure if they are maximizing deductions. Then from there they pass off their books to a CPA. 

Tax ?filing. Terrible"" - They passed their 2020 books off to their CPA last year but she still hasn't filed the taxes for them. Paul is super frustrated by this but knows its partly his fault since the books weren't perfectly organized when he passed them over. He thinks that if he gets a process in place from the time he buys something then he won't be in this position going forward. He isn't going to use the same CPA again but that means he needs help filing the 2021 taxes. Premium could be a good fit for him here."

Has a business checking account for incurring expenses. Usually is a bag of receipts that he inputs one by one onto an excel sheet. He doesn't keep track of it during the season, it's something he tries to manage during his off season (which is right now). I asked him if he ever looked into getting a bookkeeper, he said he's thought about it but doesn't have any good connections in that field.

When we initially signed him up in December we had discussed going back and catching up their books for early 2021 we were able to go back and have the conversation late Jan and he had agreed to have 4 months of catchup completed to get the books gong for filing in march 2022 

Email:

Hey Aamer, unfortunately he wasn't prepared to do all of 2021 for catch-up and tax because the first 6 months of the year are already completed by a professional service and he can't afford the tax subscription moving forward.
We got him on 4 months of CU with a 20% discount, split into 2 installments (he's still not making much money unfortunately).
Please could you run an invoice for $478.40 right away to the card on file and process another for the same amount in 2 weeks"

We set him up on a Select plan for estimates and invoices because qbo was giving him a hard time. invoicing and estimates were too time consuming

He currently has a CPA that does bookkeeping and taxes for him. He's not happy with his CPA's service. Said that he's had to file an extension every year since he's been in business, and the books are rarely done in a timely fashion. He also mentioned that every time he picks up the phone to speak with hhis CPA he feels like he's about to call his lawyer because it costs an arm and a leg to talk to him.

Set up a call with Jeff Law for 1/19 at 1:30 to discuss bench. I've already given him a rough quote for Premium and for 11 months of catchup to take advantage of Bench's offer this month to do '21 tax filing for free."

Right now they use freshbooks to categorize everything on their own and try to use general knowledge to maximize deductions. Done late at night so he knows there is a better way to spend his time. Plus he charges $350/hour so there is always a better use for his time.

Initially, he was asking me a ton of questions about taxes, categorizations, corporate structure, financial reporting etc. Eventually, I told him that if he is trying to grow the business and wants to take it to the next level he needs someone who actually knows what they are doing. After hearing about Bench he thinks it would be a great fit for someone to do the books for him so that he can focus on the growth, family, and his day job and not have to worry about it. 

He has been using FreshBooks to take care of his books up to now. He likes Freshbooks and likes that it can automate some of his processes. He didn't tell me how much time he spends on this but he said it would be a real game-changer if Bench could take the bookkeeping off his plate.
